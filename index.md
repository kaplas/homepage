Hi there! I'm a self-taught Lego engineer specializing in colorful space ships.

I'm very much interested in web, bicycles, coffee, eco, nature and slow life. From time to time I also [give talks at tech conferences](/talks).

During daytime I work as the Head of Technology at [Futurice](https://futurice.com/) Finland.
