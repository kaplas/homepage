Hi there!

I'm a self-taught Lego engineer, specializing in building colourful space ships with my daughter. I'm very much interested in parenthood, eco, nature, general well-being and slow life.

During daytime I work as a Technology Principal of Managed Services (read: as a nerd) at [Futurice](https://futurice.com/).
