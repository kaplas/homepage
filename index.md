Hi there! I'm a self-taught Lego engineer specializing in building colourful space ships with my daughter.

I'm very much interested in parenthood, eco, nature, general well-being and slow life.

During daytime I work as a Solutions Architect (read: a nerd) at [Futurice](https://futurice.com/) Tampere. From time to time I also [give talks at tech conferences](/talks).

[Blog](/blog), [Conference talks](/talks), [Github](https://github.com/kaplas/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kaplas) & [Email](mailto:contact.dp@palvelu.kaplas.fi)
