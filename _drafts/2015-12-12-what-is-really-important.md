When was the last time you really thought about your life? Thought about things that are meaningful for you? Things that makes the life worthwhile, things that make you tick... Things which have value for you.

For me it was way too many times ago.

I’ve always dreamed that I would never have to regret anything. And for the most parts I have to say I’ve succeeded. But there is a downside as well: It may not be obvious, but aiming for a life without no regrets is just another way of saying that you are targeting a life with total perfection. And when you add perfectionism to kindness, and kindness to love, you have a recipe for a total failure. Perfectionism makes no room for your own wishes, your own values or your own time; and you don’t even realize that.
